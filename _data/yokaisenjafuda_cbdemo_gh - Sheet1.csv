The bottoms of huge hanging lanterns can be seen through the gate. Gateposts and lintel are also covered with senjafuda, and the ema on the lintel is filled with more daimei. Each of these slips-within-the-slip represents a real-life senjafuda practitioner who participated in the funding of this slip.

In its orthodox form, one set of cards would each have a poem on it beginning with a different syllable. Another set of cards would have that syllable accompanied by an illustration. The picture-cards would be scattered on the floor, and one person would read the poem while other players scrambled to find the matching card. In this case, instead of a poem the lower card contains a phrase having to do with senjafuda or one of the members of the ren. Here it’s Ōta Setchō, the name of a senjafuda participant. The picture on the top card is of an oni, which of course begins with the same syllable as Ōta. The match of image to name entails a playful suggestion that Setchō himself is an oni – in this case, a rather dumpy-looking ogre with a bulbous red nose and bright red loincloth.",Unknown,,Unknown,single-page; print,Oni,Japan,35.6762,139.6503,"Gertrude Bass Warner Memorial Library, Japanese Art, Special Collections and University Archives, University of Oregon Libraries, Eugene, Oregon.

Transcript: The collection of nosatsu and their study is interesting and instructive. From the simple name placard of the older time, in the period of Ansei, the nosatsu had become an art object that [illegible] the ingenuity and showed a wide range of subject and treatment. Today it continues the traditions of the past. The monthly meetings are conducted in the same way; the democratic spirit which marked the old time gathering still continues and all kinds of men—rich and poor, high and low, wise and ignorant, there come together on equal terms. Nowhere except in the nosatsu had the fine old art of color-printing been kept continuously alive as an actual practice. Nowhere else does one find as constant use of old Japanese symbolism. No group better than the Nosatsu Kai knows old ideas and customs and keeps them constantly before the mind. No one who wishes to know Japanese art, thought, custom or character can neglect the nosatsu.
