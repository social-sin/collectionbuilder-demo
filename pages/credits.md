# About

This digital exhibition is the result of a collaboration led by [Glynne Walley (Associate Professor of East Asian Languages and Literature)](https://eall.uoregon.edu/profile/glynne/), the University of Oregon Libraries, and the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art, with individual contributions by members of both institutions (see below). 

Although this is a collaborative project, the intellectual content is primarily Glynne Walley’s, and it does not necessarily represent the views of the University of Oregon, the University of Oregon Libraries, or the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art.

The project was supported in part by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation through the grant-funded initiative “Leveraging GLAM Assets in Research, Teaching, and Learning: Mellon Faculty Fellowships to Advance Library-Museum Collaboration.” Adriene Lim, Dean of Libraries and Philip K. Knight Chair, University of Oregon Libraries, and Jill Hartz, Executive Director of the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art, are co-PIs for the grant. The initiative’s purpose is to foster collaboration between UO Libraries and the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art through a program of small grants for faculty research projects that draw on the collections and/or expertise of both institutions. Jenny Kreiger, Mellon Postdoctoral Scholar in Library-Museum Collaboration, manages this initiative.
